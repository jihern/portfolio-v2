			In an effort to improve my visual design skills, I decided to try my hand at #the100dayproject, an online campaign that encourages folks to dedicate themselves to a craft for one hundred days. Currently, I am still working towards my 100th day! You can check out my progress <a target = "_blank" class = "link" href="https://instagram.com/jbaek100/">here</a>.

		<div class = "title">Process</div>
		<div class = "text">Admittedly, my other responsibilities (school , extracurriculars, work and recruiting) do not allow me to spend much time on each illustration. However, as I am eager to improve, I try to allocate an hour for both the brainstorming and designing processes. I'll typically spend the initial time thinking of a theme; or if a theme has already been decided upon, I'll try to think of a design that could fall under that theme. If time permits, I'll begin sketching things down on my notebook. I'll go through a few quick iterations before I move on to Illustrator. From there, I'll either trace out my iteration (if it's good enough), or I'll simply reference my sketches.</div><br>
		<img class ="process" src="../Images/100 Process1.png">
		<div class = "text"><i>If I trace any sketches, as I did in this particular example, I'll spend lots of time adjusting paths.</i></div><br>
		<img class ="process" src="../Images/100 Process2.png"><div class = "text"><i>In this example, I spent time shortening the head; extending the arm length and modifying the look of the sweater; adjusting the legs and feet; and redirectioning the cat.</i></div><br>
		<img class ="process" src="../Images/100 Process3.png"><div class = "text"><i>After that, I made an artistic decision to adjust the brush strokes. This was done to follow a design decision I had made earlier so as to create the proper feel. The free form brush strokes manifest a very human visual and emotion - imperfect standalone yet complete together.</i></div><br>
		<img class ="process" src="../Images/100 Process4.png"><div class = "text"><i>That leads to the final product. Each design, of course, varies in terms of process; but as an invariant, I learn a new skill with each design.</i></div>

		<div class = "title">Takeaway</div>
		<div class = "text">
			<i>Though I still have a ways to go until I finish, here are some things that I've learned</i>:
			<ol><li>If you can, spend an hour thinking and planning out what you want to create. It takes a lot of thought to create illustrations directly from your imagination, and drawing first helps.</li><br>
			<li>On the flip side, if you don't have time, don't panic. Putting time constraints on yourself can also be beneficial. A good friend of mine once told me that one's best, most creative work comes when they are most constrained.</li><br>
			<li>I use reference images way too much, and I'm beginning to understand the difference between an expert designer from an amateur designer: the ability to imagine details and draw them from your and others' experiences.</li><br>
			<li>Do this with a friend! I have the pleasure of embarking on the journey that is the #100dayproject with my good friend, Wendy Xue. It makes it easier to hold yourself accountable and provides a channel to receive honest, critical feedback.
