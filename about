				Hi, my name is <b>Ji-hern Baek</b>, and I'm passionate about people. I want to learn everything I can about others - their idiosyncrasies, their stories and experiences, their growth. In doing so, I learn a lot about myself, too.<br><br>
				Accordingly, I am an aspiring UX and product designer, finding joy in the intersection between people, design, and technology. Currently, I work as a visual design intern on two launched products: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ember-temperature-adjustable-mug#/" target="_blank">Ember</a> and <a href="https://shop.leeo.com/" target="_blank">Leeo</a>. This past summer, I balanced my time as a UX design intern at a VR startup called <a href="http://www.fulldive.com" target= "_blank">FullDive</a>, and as a styling and marketing intern at <a href="https://trueandco.com/" target="_blank">True&Co.</a>, a lingerie e-commerce startup.<br><br>
				Additionally, I am currently a fourth year at UC Berkeley, majoring in Cognitive Science (with a concentration in Society, Culture, and Cognition) and minoring in Computer Science. At Cal, I've found that I am best able to exercise my passions by being involved. I served as the president of Cal's Korean American Student Association; was involved in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtistsInResonance" target="_blank">a cappella group</a>; currently work in our university's <a href="https://asuc.org/" target="_blank">ASUC</a>; and am involved in <a href="http://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/berkeleyinnovation/" target="_blank">Berkeley Innovation</a> - two of Cal's design organizations.
